# Hangman
Hangman is a game where players must correctly guess a hidden word by picking letters that may or may not be in the word. They will lose if a certain number of incorrect guesses is reached.

The aim of this project is to create the Hangman game where users have to guess a secret word randomly chosen from a list. Python is the language used for this project.
